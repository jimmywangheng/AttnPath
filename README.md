# AttnPath

This is my paper, Incorporating Graph Attention Mechanism into Knowledge Graph Reasoning Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, which has been accepted as a long paper of EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019.

Source code can be found in the appendices of https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1264/ , which have not been encapsulated and commented enough. Since I'm busy working in Tencent, I don't have too much time to reorder the code.
